### Course Information

The aim of this course is to provide a more detailed look into algorithms in computational molecular biology, with a focus on applications to genetics. The course is organized into five chapters:

1. BLAST and Karlin-Altschul Statistics
2. Genome Assembly and Lander-Waterman Statistics
3. Coalescent Theory and Ancestral Recombination Graphs
4. Hidden Markov Models: The Learning Problem
5. Clustering Theory and Spectral Clustering

### FAQ
<details>
  <summary>Who takes the course?</summary>
    CS182 is the sequel to CS181, but tends to attract not only students from the computational biology concentration, but also those in computer science, biology, and applied mathematics. This course assumes in-depth knowledge of a programming language of your choice (python is strongly recommended). Be sure to talk to one of the course staff if you are unsure whether the course is a good fit for you!

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What biology background is needed?</summary>
  There are no biology prerequisites, and no prior biology knowledge is assumed; the material that you need to know will be covered in class.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What computer science and mathematics background is needed?</summary>
  In order to take this course, you must have taken CS181 in a past semester. From CS181, recall that students in the course generally have some prior exposure to basic concepts of discrete math (graphs, recurrence relations), discrete probability (random variables, independence), and algorithms (big-O notation, pseudocode).

<details>
  <summary>What programming background is needed?</summary>
  This class is more programming intensive than CS181, so if you had the programming prerequisites for CS181 waived, make sure you spend some time brushing up on your programming skills before the semester starts. If you are at all worried that any of these requirements will be a barrier during the semester, please reach out to one of the course staff – we would love to have everyone interested feel comfortable taking the course!

<details>
  <summary>I am interested in learning how to analyze *-Seq data from my (advisor's) lab.
  Will this course help me?</summary>

  Possibly, but perhaps not in the way that you expect. The goals of CS181 are to teach the algorithmic concepts that underlie a wide variety of software that is used to analyze biological data, particularly in genetics, genomics, and proteomics. The course will not teach you how to use any particular biological software package. Rather, you will learn how this software works, and more importantly for the long-term, how to think about biological problems in a computational way. Thus, when the latest and greatest technology for measuring DNA/RNA/protein is released in 5 or 10 years' time, you will have some algorithmic skills to work with this data, without waiting for the rest of the community to develop tools. If your interests are more narrowly focused on a particular, near-term application, another course might be more appropriate.
